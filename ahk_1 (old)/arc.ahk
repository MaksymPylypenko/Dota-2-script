; The issue:
; Arc's and Tempest Double's necro book can not be pernamently assigned to different hot-keys. Thus, it is not trivial to send both necro books on different camps relatively quickly.

; Quick bind:
; If you have a hero and 2 summons selected, deselects the first unit (e.g. Arc or Tempest Double) and binds the rest to a specific hotkey.
